By default with a clean install of Linux Mint 20.01, the user is not prompted to configure their online accounts such as Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox etc.

## Installing Online Accounts

In _Terminal_, run the following code:

    sudo apt install gnome-online-accounts
    XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=GNOME gnome-control-centre

The you can enter the details for your Google Drive, Dropbox, One Drive etc in the dialogue box that launches.
